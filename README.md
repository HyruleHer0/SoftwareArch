##SW Arch GitHub Assignment 1##

##Assignment details:##

##Overview:## 
Practice using version control to create and edit projects with multiple team members. 

##Assignment:## 
+Create a simple text-based auction application to facilitate buying and selling of items. Create a class diagram view with description of classes and their relationships. Use GIT to manage code contributed by each team member. 
+Create a GitHub project account for your team. Each team member must have their own account. 
+Complete the GIT tutorial “Getting Started” and “Collaboration” sections here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/?utm_source=bitbucket&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=homepage&utm_content=free_git_tutorials

	+Each class should contain additional relevant member data (even if not used in program)

##Architecture / Design View##
+Create UML Class Diagram for system
+Provide brief description / overview of the diagram constraints
+All code, diagrams, and description should be uploaded and managed using GitHub
+Each team member must contribute code to the repository
+Comments should be constructive 
+Additional requirement will be given after class for minor change implementation
